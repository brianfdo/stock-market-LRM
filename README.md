Using a Linear Regression Model to predict future stock prices.

Using the Quandl API, I managed to access data of stock prices from the past decade. I used this data to train a Linear Regression Model in order to predict future stock prices. This model is definitely not an accurate representation of how stock prices fluctuate in reality since there are other outside factors that may influence stock prices. However, this project helped me learn about how linear regression works and how I could potentially generate predictions of future data.
